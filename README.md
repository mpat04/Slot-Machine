Slot Machine Terminal Gambling Game

This program runs a Slot Machine Gambling game in your terminal.

All of the code is implemented within the main.py file.

Once you run the program you will be prompted with how much money you would like to deposit into the game. Then the program will ask you how many lines you would like to bet on. Third, the game will ask how much you would like to bet on each line.

You may quit the game after any roll by simply entering 'q' when prompted.
